The Encrypted Password Vault for OS Login is a secure authentication module designed to enhance the security of operating systems by encrypting and managing user credentials. 
The project ensures that passwords are stored securely using strong encryption techniques, reducing the risk of credential theft, brute-force attacks, and unauthorized access. 
This vault integrates with the OS login system, enabling seamless authentication while adding an extra layer of protection against vulnerabilities like keylogging and unauthorized password access. 
The system supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) and recovery mechanisms, ensuring that users have a reliable and secure method for accessing their accounts. 
With the increasing need for strong cybersecurity practices, this project aims to offer a practical and robust solution for secure authentication in operating systems.

Login Attempt:
The process starts when the user attempts to log in.
Lockout Check:
The system checks if the user is locked out due to previous failed attempts. If yes, it denies access and logs the failure.
Password Input:
If not locked out, the user is prompted to enter their password.
Password Decryption:
The system retrieves the encrypted password from the vault and decrypts it using Libsodium.
Integrity Check:
A HMAC check verifies that the decrypted password has not been tampered with.
Password Comparison:
The system compares the user-entered password with the decrypted (and verified) password.
A match leads to the MFA step.
A mismatch logs the failed attempt and may trigger a lockout.
Multi-Factor Authentication:
If the password is correct, the user is prompted for a One-Time Password (OTP) generated by Google Authenticator.
The OTP is verified:
If valid, access is granted and the event is logged.
If invalid, the failure is logged, and repeated failures may trigger alerts and IP banning via Fail2Ban.

Security Alerts and Fail2Ban:
In case of multiple failed attempts, an alert script is triggered and Fail2Ban automatically blocks the offending IP.
This flow chart gives you an overview of how each component of the project interacts to secure the authentication process. You can adjust or expand this flow chart as needed to match any additional modules or enhancements in your system.
